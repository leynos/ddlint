  Add a comma before "%[2]s": it links two independent clauses.

# Keep this to sentence text; avoid headings/lists where fragments are common.
scope:
  - sentence
  - ~heading
  - ~list

# Heuristic:
#  - there’s a verb before the coordinator,
#  - the coordinator is one of FANBOYS,
#  - a likely subject starts the following clause,
#  - and a verb occurs soon after that subject.
tokens:
  # Any finite/aux verb somewhere before the conjunction (left clause).
  - tag: VB|VBD|VBP|VBZ|VBG|VBN|MD
    skip: 60

  # The coordinating conjunction.
  - pattern: '(?:for|and|nor|but|or|yet|so)'

  # Likely subject starting the right-hand clause.
  - tag: PRP|EX|DT|NN|NNS|NNP|NNPS
    skip: 8

  # And then a verb (or modal) within a few tokens.
  - tag: VB|VBD|VBP|VBZ|VBG|VBN|MD

# Quick Fix: turn the single whitespace before the coordinator into ", ".
# The regex runs against the matched sequence and only fires if there’s NOT
# already a comma/colon/semicolon/dash immediately before the conjunction.

# Known constructions that shouldn't take a comma even though they contain a
# coordinator. Add these patterns to TokenIgnores in .vale.ini if they become
# noisy:
#   \bnot only\b.+\bbut also\b
#   \bboth\b.+\band\b
#   \beither\b.+\bor\b
#   \bneither\b.+\bnor\b
#   \bso that\b
