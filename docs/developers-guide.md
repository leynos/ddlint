# Developer guide

This guide records the parser module structure introduced by issue `#223`.
It is intentionally narrow and documents ownership boundaries rather than the
full parsing pipeline.

## Parser module structure

### `src/parser/ast/expr/sexpr.rs`

- Owns S-expression rendering helpers for `Expr`.
- Supports test and fixture comparisons without coupling callers to debug
  formatting.
- Should remain presentation-only; parsing and semantic classification belong
  elsewhere.

### `src/parser/ast/rule/classification.rs`

- Owns rule-body term classification for raw literals.
- Handles assignment parsing, aggregation detection, and `for`-loop lowering
  within the rule-body helper path.
- Keeps rule-body classification separate from the public `Rule` wrapper so
  `rule.rs` stays focused on the surface API.

### `src/parser/expression/pratt/postfix.rs`

- Owns postfix dispatch for the Pratt parser.
- Routes function calls, bit slices, field access, tuple indexing, method
  calls, and delay postfixes to the appropriate helper.
- Coordinates the pending diff-marker state across the postfix chain.

### `src/parser/expression/pratt/diff.rs`

- Owns diff-marker tracking and validation.
- Wraps completed postfix expressions in `Expr::AtomDiff` when a diff marker
  is pending.
- Emits the targeted diagnostics for duplicate, misplaced, or dangling diff
  markers.

### `src/parser/expression/pratt/delay.rs`

- Owns `expr -<N>` postfix parsing.
- Consumes the `-<` token pair, reads the delay literal, and returns
  `Expr::AtomDelay` on success.
- Keeps delay-specific validation separate from the generic postfix loop.

## Boundary rules

- Keep formatting helpers in `sexpr.rs` rather than mixing them into the core
  expression parser.
- Keep rule-body classification in `classification.rs` rather than adding
  helper-stage logic to `rule.rs`.
- Keep postfix dispatch in `postfix.rs`; add new postfix behaviour there only
  when it needs shared chain state.
- Keep diff-marker state and delay parsing in their dedicated submodules so
  `pratt.rs` remains the central parser entry point.
